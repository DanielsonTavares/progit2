== Git: O Básico

Se você pudesse ler apenas um capítulo para começar a utilizar o Git, é este.
Este capítulo abrange todos os comandos básicos que você utilizará na maior parte do tempo em que estiver usando o Git.
By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes.
We'll also show you how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

Next, we'll cover Git's killer feature: its branching model.
